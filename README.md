# My Hobbies
- I love to game. From a young age I would play video games with my brother on the PS2 (ahh the memories). I loved to play crash bandicoot and me and my brother would often stay up all night to finish the game just to play it again from the start the next day (lol). I currently like to play fifa, fortnite, tekken and mortal kombat
- I like to play tennis in the park with friends and family (best in the evening times)
- This is a pretty academic related one but I like to do leetcode often just for fun, I find it very intellectually stimuating and interesting
